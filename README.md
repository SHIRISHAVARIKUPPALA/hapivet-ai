problem Statement:AI-Based SOAP Note Segmentation from Audio
Automated Clinical Note Generation Using Speech Transcription and NLP

Overview:
his project implements an AI-powered medical transcription system that converts audio or video consultations into structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes automatically.

The system takes a recorded patient–receptionist or patient–doctor conversation, performs:

Speech-to-text transcription using OpenAI’s Whisper model,

Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract clinical insights, and

SOAP segmentation to organize the text into a structured, interpretable medical note.

All generated results, including the transcript and SOAP components, are stored in a downloadable Excel file for easy review and integration with hospital record systems.


Key Features (Point-wise Explanation)

🎙️ Audio/Video Upload

Supports uploading of recorded medical conversations in common formats such as .mp3, .wav, .mp4, and .m4a.

Easily uploads directly through the Google Colab interface for testing and demonstration.

🔊 Automatic Audio Extraction

Automatically extracts audio tracks from uploaded video files using the moviepy library.

Ensures seamless processing for both audio-only and video-based inputs.

🧠 Speech-to-Text Conversion

Utilizes OpenAI Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model.

Accurately transcribes medical speech into clean, readable text suitable for analysis.

📋 NLP-Based SOAP Segmentation

Employs spaCy for natural language processing (NLP) to understand and split transcribed text into the four medical documentation components:

Subjective: Patient’s reported symptoms and experiences.

Objective: Observed or measured facts (vitals, tests, etc.).

Assessment: Possible diagnosis or doctor’s impression.

Plan: Recommended treatment or next steps.

📊 Structured Data Storage

Stores all extracted information — including full transcript, summary, and SOAP sections — in a structured Excel file (.xlsx).

Facilitates easy review, reporting, or integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems.

🔁 Record Update Feature

Detects if a file with the same name has been previously processed.

Automatically updates the existing record instead of creating duplicates, ensuring data consistency.

IntelliSOAP — AI-Powered Real-Time Medical Documentation System
Transforming Clinical Workflows Through Intelligent, Voice-Driven SOAP Note Generation
Overview:

IntelliSOAP is an advanced AI-driven clinical documentation assistant that captures, analyzes, and summarizes patient–receptionist conversations in real time to automatically generate structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes.

When a patient calls the hospital, the system:

Listens to and transcribes the conversation as it happens,

Extracts key medical information such as symptoms, duration, and medical history,

Retrieves contextual data from Electronic Health Records (EHR), including lab results and prior medications, and

Synthesizes a complete, doctor-ready SOAP note before the call is concluded.

This enables clinicians to review well-organized, data-enriched summaries within seconds, saving valuable consultation time and improving clinical decision-making accuracy.
System Features (Point-wise Explanation)

🎙️ Real-Time Voice Data Capture

Continuously captures live conversations between patients and receptionists during calls.

Converts spoken words into real-time transcriptions using advanced speech-to-text technology.

Enables automatic recording of patient complaints and symptoms without manual note-taking.

🧠 Intelligent Context Extraction

Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and medical ontologies such as ICD-10 and SNOMED-CT.

Automatically detects symptoms, medical complaints, risk factors, and relevant clinical terms.

Reduces errors and ensures semantic understanding of patient data.

🧾 Automated SOAP Note Generation

Converts extracted text into a standardized SOAP format:

Subjective: Patient’s reported symptoms and experiences.

Objective: Observations, vitals, or measured findings.

Assessment: Diagnosis or clinical impression.

Plan: Recommended treatment or next steps.

Saves doctors’ time by generating ready-to-review notes instantly before consultation.

🧬 EHR & Lab Integration

Connects to Electronic Health Records (EHR), lab databases, and prescription systems.

Fetches past lab reports, medication history, and diagnostic data for context-aware note generation.

Ensures a holistic patient view during clinical evaluation.

👩‍⚕️ Physician Dashboard

Provides doctors with a unified interface displaying structured SOAP notes, linked reports, and recommendations.

Supports interactive editing, follow-up tracking, and decision support suggestions.

Designed for ease of interpretation and clinical efficiency.

🔒 Data Privacy & Compliance

Implements end-to-end encryption for secure data transmission and storage.

Fully compliant with HIPAA (U.S.) and GDPR (EU) healthcare data protection standards.

Employs role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access.
